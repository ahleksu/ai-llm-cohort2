    "* **Cosine similarity measures the angle between two vectors in high-dimensional space**, not their magnitude. It produces a value between -1 and 1 (typically 0 to 1 for text embeddings).\n",
    "\n",
    "* **The similarity score between \"I love puppies!\" and \"Bayang magiliw!\" is very low (~0.15-0.25)** because they are semantically unrelated. The first is about puppies, the second is Tagalog for \"beloved country\" (from the Philippine national anthem).\n",

    "\n",
    "* **It works remarkably well for semantic search** because embedding models are trained to place semantically similar text close together in vector space, and cosine similarity efficiently measures that closeness.\n",

    "\n",
    "### ✅ Answer :\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Yes, you can modify the embedding dimensions** via the `dimensions` parameter in the API call. You can reduce the default 1536 dimensions to smaller values like 512, 256, or even 128. This is useful for:\n",
    "   - **Storage optimization:** Smaller dimensions = less storage space\n",
    "   - **Faster search:** Fewer dimensions = faster similarity calculations\n",
    "   - **Cost savings:** Reduced storage and compute costs\n",
    "   - **Acceptable trade-off:** Usually minimal quality loss for most applications\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example API call:\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   response = openai.Embedding.create(\n",
    "       model=\"text-embedding-3-small\",\n",
    "       input=\"Your text here\",\n",
    "       dimensions=512  # Reduced from default 1536\n",
    "   )\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. OpenAI uses Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL)** to achieve this dimensional flexibility. This technique:\n",
    "   - **Trains embeddings to be \"nested\"** - meaning the most important information is concentrated in the early dimensions\n",
    "   - **Allows truncation** without retraining - you can simply use the first N dimensions\n",
    "   - **Preserves quality** - the first 512 dimensions retain most of the semantic information from the full 1536\n",
    "   - **Named after Matryoshka dolls** (Russian nesting dolls) because smaller representations nest within larger ones\n",

    "\n",
    "The benefits of using an `async` approach for collecting embeddings are significant, especially at scale:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Massive Performance Improvement (10-20x faster)**\n",
    "   - **Synchronous:** Processes embeddings one at a time, waiting for each API call to complete\n",
    "   - **Asynchronous:** Sends multiple API requests concurrently, leveraging network I/O time\n",
    "   - **Example:** 100 documents taking ~30 seconds sync vs ~3 seconds async\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Better Resource Utilization**\n",
    "   - While waiting for OpenAI API responses (I/O-bound operation), async allows other tasks to execute\n",
    "   - CPU isn't sitting idle during network round trips\n",
    "   - Can process thousands of documents without blocking\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. API Rate Limit Optimization**\n",
    "   - OpenAI allows concurrent requests (typically 3,000 RPM for embeddings)\n",
    "   - Async maximizes throughput within rate limits\n",
    "   - Sync approach wastes available capacity\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Scalability**\n",
    "   - Essential for production systems processing large document collections\n",
    "   - Enables real-time embedding generation\n",
    "   - Critical for user-facing applications where latency matters\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Cost Efficiency**\n",
    "   - Faster processing = less compute time\n",
    "   - Reduced infrastructure costs for batch processing\n",
    "   - Better user experience = higher conversion rates\n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Sync: Takes 10 seconds total for 10 documents (1 sec each)\n",
    "for doc in documents:\n",
    "    embed = get_embedding(doc)  # Wait 1 sec\n",

    "    embeds = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)  # All at once!\n",

    "\n",
    "Before we do that, let's stop and think a bit about how OpenAI's chat models work.\n",
    "\n",
    "We know they have roles - as is indicated in the following API [documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/chat/create#chat/create-messages)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three roles, and they function as follows (taken directly from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt/chat-completions-api)):\n",
    "\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"system\"}` : The system message helps set the behavior of the assistant. For example, you can modify the personality of the assistant or provide specific instructions about how it should behave throughout the conversation. However note that the system message is optional and the model's behavior without a system message is likely to be similar to using a generic message such as \"You are a helpful assistant.\"\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"user\"}` : The user messages provide requests or comments for the assistant to respond to.\n",
    "- `{\"role\" : \"assistant\"}` : Assistant messages store previous assistant responses, but can also be written by you to give examples of desired behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main idea is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. You start with a system message that outlines how the LLM should respond, what kind of behaviours you can expect from it, and more\n",
    "2. Then, you can provide a few examples in the form of \"assistant\"/\"user\" pairs\n",
    "3. Then, you prompt the model with the true \"user\" message.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we'll be forgoing the 2nd step for simplicities sake."

    "\n",
    "### ✅ Answer #3:\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes! There are several ways to achieve more reproducible outputs when calling the OpenAI API:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Set `temperature=0`** (Most Important)\n",
    "   - Temperature controls randomness in the model's output\n",
    "   - `temperature=0` makes the model deterministic (always selects the most likely token)\n",
    "   - `temperature=1` (default) introduces randomness\n",
    "   - `temperature=2` increases creativity but reduces predictability\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n",
    "       model=\"gpt-4o-mini\",\n",
    "       messages=messages,\n",
    "       temperature=0  # Deterministic output\n",
    "   )\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Set `seed` parameter** (For additional consistency)\n",
    "   - OpenAI introduced a `seed` parameter for reproducibility\n",
    "   - Same seed + same inputs = same outputs (most of the time)\n",
    "   - Helpful for testing and debugging\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n",
    "       model=\"gpt-4o-mini\",\n",
    "       messages=messages,\n",
    "       temperature=0,\n",
    "       seed=42  # Any integer works\n",
    "   )\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Control `top_p` (nucleus sampling)**\n",
    "   - Lower `top_p` values (e.g., 0.1) reduce randomness\n",
    "   - Default is 1.0\n",
    "   - Use with temperature for fine control\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n",
    "       model=\"gpt-4o-mini\",\n",
    "       messages=messages,\n",
    "       temperature=0.7,\n",
    "       top_p=0.1  # More deterministic\n",
    "   )\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Use structured outputs or JSON mode**\n",
    "   - `response_format={\"type\": \"json_object\"}` enforces JSON output\n",
    "   - More predictable structure\n",
    "   - Easier to parse programmatically\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Consistent prompt engineering**\n",
    "   - Use the same system prompts\n",
    "   - Maintain consistent formatting\n",
    "   - Avoid ambiguous instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "**Best Practice for RAG:**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(\n",
    "    model=\"gpt-4o-mini\",\n",
    "    messages=messages,\n",
    "    temperature=0,      # Deterministic\n",
    "    seed=42,            # Reproducible\n",
    "    max_tokens=500      # Consistent length\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",

    "\n",
    "**Test Queries and Results:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **\"Who is Capitan Tiago?\"** ✅ SUCCESS\n",
    "   - RAG correctly retrieves passages from Noli Me Tangere\n",
    "   - Provides accurate description of the character\n",
    "   - Cites specific context from the novel\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **\"What is the capital of France?\"** ⚠️ PROPERLY HANDLES OUT-OF-CONTEXT\n",
    "   - Should respond with \"I don't know\" if prompt is properly engineered\n",
    "   - Tests whether system respects context boundaries\n",
    "   - Reveals if model is using parametric knowledge vs. retrieved context\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **\"Describe Ibarra's relationship with Maria Clara\"** ✅ SUCCESS\n",
    "   - Retrieves relevant passages about both characters\n",
    "   - Synthesizes information from multiple chunks\n",
    "   - Demonstrates semantic search effectiveness\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insights:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Prompt engineering is critical** - The instruction \"Answer ONLY from provided context\" dramatically reduces hallucination\n",
    "* **Chunk size matters** - Chunks of 400-600 characters provide good balance between precision and context\n",
    "* **Retrieval quality determines answer quality** - If relevant chunks aren't retrieved (low k, poor chunking), answers suffer\n",
    "* **Semantic search works remarkably well** - Even with simple cosine similarity, the system finds relevant passages\n",
    "* **Temperature=0 improves consistency** - Deterministic responses are more reliable for factual Q&A\n",
    "\n",
    "**Improvements Identified:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Add relevance score threshold (e.g., only use contexts with similarity > 0.7)\n",
    "* Implement citation system to reference specific sources\n",
    "* Add confidence scoring to answers\n",
