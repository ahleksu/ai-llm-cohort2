# Day 4: RAG Evaluation with RAGAS and Synthetic Data Generation

## üìñ Overview

Day 4 focuses on the critical task of evaluating RAG systems. You'll learn why evaluation matters, how to generate synthetic test datasets, and how to measure RAG performance systematically using the RAGAS framework. This day bridges the gap between building RAG systems (Day 3) and optimizing them (Day 5).

## üéØ Objectives

- Understand why evaluation is essential for RAG systems
- Learn the RAGAS evaluation framework and its metrics
- Generate synthetic test datasets programmatically
- Evaluate baseline RAG pipelines
- Compare advanced retrieval strategies (Multi-Query Retriever)
- Make data-driven decisions about RAG architecture

## üìù Activities

### Notebook 1: RAGAS Evaluation (`1-ragas.ipynb`)

**Learning Path:**

1. **Why Evaluate?**
   - "You cannot improve what you cannot measure"
   - Evaluation ensures accuracy, reliability, and context relevance
   - Identifies biases and optimizes performance
   - Builds user trust through consistent quality

2. **Building a Baseline RAG Pipeline**
   - Load LOTR (Book One) as test corpus
   - Implement RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
   - Create QDrant vector store
   - Build simple retrieval chain with LCEL

3. **Understanding RAGAS Metrics**
   - **Faithfulness:** Is the answer grounded in context?
   - **Answer Relevancy:** Does it address the question?
   - **Context Precision:** Are top contexts relevant?
   - **Context Recall:** Are all relevant contexts retrieved?
   - **Answer Correctness:** Semantic + factual accuracy

4. **Generating Test Datasets**
   - Load pre-generated test questions
   - Extract ground truth answers
   - Create evaluation-ready datasets

5. **Baseline Evaluation**
   - Run RAG pipeline on test questions
   - Collect contexts and answers
   - Evaluate with RAGAS metrics
   - Analyze results

6. **Advanced Retrieval with MultiQueryRetriever**
   - Understand query expansion
   - Implement MultiQueryRetriever
   - Re-evaluate with same metrics
   - Compare baseline vs. advanced

**Key Questions Answered:**
- ‚úÖ How many chunks were generated? (Calculated from documents)
- ‚úÖ What does MultiQueryRetriever do? (Generates multiple query variations for better retrieval)
- ‚úÖ Why did the model respond better? (More comprehensive context retrieval)
- ‚úÖ What's the performance difference? (Quantified via RAGAS metrics)

### Notebook 2: Synthetic Data Generation (`2-SDG.ipynb`)

**Learning Path:**

1. **The Challenge of Test Data**
   - Manual test creation is time-consuming
   - Need diverse, representative questions
   - Ground truth answers are critical

2. **Synthetic Data Generation (SDG)**
   - Use LLMs to generate test questions
   - Create ground truth from documents
   - Generate diverse question types
   - Scale test coverage efficiently

3. **Question Generation Strategies**
   - Factual questions (who, what, when, where)
   - Reasoning questions (why, how)
   - Comparison questions
   - Multi-hop questions

4. **Dataset Quality Assurance**
   - Validate generated questions
   - Check answer relevance
   - Ensure diversity
   - Maintain consistency

## üîç Key Concepts Learned

### RAGAS Metrics Explained

#### 1. **Faithfulness** (0-1 scale)
- Measures if the answer is grounded in retrieved context
- Calculated by: # verified claims / # total claims
- High faithfulness = low hallucination

**Example:**
```
Context: "Frodo is the ring bearer"
Answer: "Frodo carries the ring" ‚Üí Faithful ‚úÖ
Answer: "Frodo is from Gondor" ‚Üí Not faithful ‚ùå
```

#### 2. **Answer Relevancy** (0-1 scale)
- Measures how well the answer addresses the question
- Uses cosine similarity between question and answer embeddings
- Penalizes incomplete or tangential answers

**Example:**
```
Question: "Who is the ring bearer?"
Answer: "Frodo" ‚Üí Highly relevant ‚úÖ
Answer: "The Fellowship traveled through Middle-earth" ‚Üí Low relevance ‚ùå
```

#### 3. **Context Precision** (0-1 scale)
- Measures if relevant contexts are ranked higher
- Checks if top-k retrieved contexts are actually useful
- Indicates retrieval quality

**Formula:**
$$
\text{Context Precision@k} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{k} (\text{Relevant}_i \times \text{Precision}_i)}{\text{Total Relevant in Top-k}}
$$

#### 4. **Context Recall** (0-1 scale)
- Measures if all relevant information was retrieved
- Compares ground truth with retrieved contexts
- Indicates completeness of retrieval

**Formula:**
$$
\text{Context Recall} = \frac{\text{# Ground truth claims in contexts}}{\text{# Total ground truth claims}}
$$

#### 5. **Answer Correctness** (0-1 scale)
- Combines semantic similarity and factual accuracy
- Weighted average of both components
- Most comprehensive single metric

**Formula:**
$$
\text{Answer Correctness} = w_1 \cdot \text{Semantic Sim} + w_2 \cdot \text{Factual Sim}
$$

### Multi-Query Retrieval

**How it Works:**
```
Original Query: "Who is the ring bearer?"

‚Üì LLM generates variations ‚Üì

1. "Which character carries the One Ring?"
2. "Who possesses the ring in Lord of the Rings?"
3. "What hobbit bears the ring?"

‚Üì Retrieve for each query ‚Üì

Contexts from Query 1: [doc1, doc2, doc3]
Contexts from Query 2: [doc2, doc4, doc5]
Contexts from Query 3: [doc1, doc3, doc6]

‚Üì Merge and deduplicate ‚Üì

Final Context: [doc1, doc2, doc3, doc4, doc5, doc6]
```

**Benefits:**
- Captures different phrasings
- Overcomes vocabulary mismatch
- Retrieves more comprehensive context
- Improves recall significantly

**Trade-offs:**
- 3-5x more API calls (cost)
- Slightly slower retrieval
- May introduce noise if queries diverge
