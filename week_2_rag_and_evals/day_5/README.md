## üîç Key Concepts Learned

### Retrieval Strategy Comparison

| Strategy | Strengths | Weaknesses | Best Use Case |
|----------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| **Naive Semantic** | Simple, fast, works well generally | Misses exact keywords | General Q&A |
| **BM25** | Exact keyword matching, interpretable | No semantic understanding | Legal, technical docs |
| **Multi-Query** | Better recall, handles synonyms | Higher cost, slower | Complex queries |
| **Parent-Document** | Full context, coherent chunks | More retrieval overhead | Long-form content |
| **Reranking** | Highest precision | Extra API call, cost | Quality-critical apps |
| **Ensemble** | Combines strengths | Complex configuration | Production systems |
| **Semantic Chunking** | Natural boundaries | Slower preprocessing | Narrative documents |

### BM25 Algorithm

**Best Matching 25** - Classic information retrieval algorithm

**Key Concepts:**
- **Term Frequency (TF):** How often a term appears in a document
- **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF):** How rare a term is across corpus
- **Document Length Normalization:** Prevents bias toward long documents

**Formula:**
$$
\text{BM25}(q, d) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{IDF}(q_i) \cdot \frac{f(q_i, d) \cdot (k_1 + 1)}{f(q_i, d) + k_1 \cdot (1 - b + b \cdot \frac{|d|}{\text{avgdl}})}
$$

Where:
- $q_i$ = query term
- $f(q_i, d)$ = term frequency in document
- $|d|$ = document length
- $k_1$ = term frequency saturation (typically 1.2-2.0)
- $b$ = length normalization (typically 0.75)

**When to Use:**
- Exact keyword matching required (legal, medical)
- Short documents (tweets, product descriptions)
- Users search with specific terms
- Explainability is important

**Example:**
```
Query: "loan interest rate"
Semantic Search: Might return "mortgage APR" (similar meaning)
BM25: Returns exact matches for "interest rate"
```

### Reranking (Contextual Compression)

**Two-Stage Retrieval:**
```
Stage 1: Retrieve (broad net, k=10-20)
   ‚Üì
Stage 2: Rerank (precise ordering)
   ‚Üì
Final: Top-3 most relevant
```

**How Cohere Rerank Works:**
- Cross-encoder architecture (not bi-encoder like embeddings)
- Processes query + document pairs together
- Returns relevance scores (0-1)
- Much more accurate than cosine similarity

**Performance Impact:**
```
Without Reranking:
- Context Precision: 0.65
- Often includes noise in top results

With Reranking:
- Context Precision: 0.85-0.90
- Top results are highly relevant
```

**Trade-offs:**
- Additional API call (~50ms latency)
- Extra cost per query
- Requires another service dependency
- But: 20-30% improvement in answer quality

### Ensemble Retrieval

**Combining Multiple Retrievers:**

```python
ensemble_retriever = EnsembleRetriever(
    retrievers=[semantic_retriever, bm25_retriever],
    weights=[0.6, 0.4]  # Favor semantic slightly
)
```

**Fusion Strategies:**

1. **Weighted Sum:**
   - Multiply scores by weights
   - Sum across retrievers
   - Re-rank by combined score

2. **Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF):**
   $$
   \text{RRF}(d) = \sum_{r \in R} \frac{1}{k + \text{rank}_r(d)}
   $$
   - Robust to score scale differences
   - Used in search engines

3. **Maximum Score:**
   - Take highest score from any retriever
   - Useful when retrievers are specialized

**Benefits:**
- Captures both semantic and keyword matches
- More robust to query variations
- Better coverage of relevant documents

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Weight tuning is important
- May need query-type routing
- Complexity vs. improvement trade-off

### Semantic Chunking

**Problem with Fixed-Size Chunking:**
```
"The meeting concluded with a decision. [CHUNK BREAK] The 
decision was to proceed with the project..."
```
‚Üí Context is split awkwardly

**Semantic Chunking Solution:**
- Identify natural boundaries (paragraphs, sections)
- Keep related content together
- Variable chunk sizes based on semantics

**Methods:**
1. **Sentence Similarity:**
   - Compute similarity between consecutive sentences
   - Split where similarity drops
   
2. **Topic Modeling:**
   - Identify topic shifts
   - Chunk by topic coherence

3. **Structure-Aware:**
   - Use document structure (headers, bullets)
   - Preserve hierarchical relationships

**Trade-offs:**
- Better context preservation
- More complex preprocessing
- Variable chunk sizes (harder to manage)
- May be slower

## üí° Interesting Findings

### Top 3 Insights from Day 5

#### 1. **Reranking Provides Biggest Single Improvement** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Discovery:**
- Adding reranking to any retriever boosts Context Precision by 20-30%
- Minimal latency cost (~50ms)
- Works as a "universal upgrade"

**Performance:**
```
Naive + Reranking:
- Context Precision: 0.65 ‚Üí 0.87 (+34%)
- Answer Quality: Noticeably better

Cost: ~$0.002 per query (Cohere Rerank)
```

**Recommendation:** Add reranking before other optimizations

---

#### 2. **BM25 + Semantic = Powerful Ensemble** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Discovery:**
- BM25 catches exact keywords semantic search misses
- Semantic search handles paraphrasing BM25 fails on
- Together, they're greater than the sum of parts

**Example Query:** "What are the fees?"
```
BM25 alone: Finds "fees" mentions, misses "charges", "costs"
Semantic alone: Finds "costs", might miss exact "fees"
Ensemble: Captures all variations
```

**Optimal Weighting:** 60% semantic, 40% BM25 (for most use cases)

---

#### 3. **Multi-Query Shines on Ambiguous Queries** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê

**Discovery:**
- For clear queries: minimal improvement
- For ambiguous queries: 30-50% better recall

**Example:**
```
Clear Query: "Who is Frodo?"
‚Üí Multi-Query marginal gain

Ambiguous Query: "Tell me about the bearer"
‚Üí Generates: "Who carries the ring?", "Ring bearer identity", "Frodo's role"
‚Üí Much better context retrieval
```

**Recommendation:** Use selectively based on query analysis

## üìä Evaluation Results

### Comparative Performance (Loan Complaints Dataset)

**Test Query:** "What is the most common issue with loans?"

| Strategy | Context Prec. | Context Recall | Answer Rel. | Latency | Cost |
|----------|---------------|----------------|-------------|---------|------|
| Naive | 0.65 | 0.68 | 0.81 | 150ms | $0.001 |
| BM25 Only | 0.60 | 0.65 | 0.78 | 100ms | $0 |
| Multi-Query | 0.70 | 0.82 | 0.86 | 450ms | $0.003 |
| + Reranking | 0.87 | 0.82 | 0.92 | 500ms | $0.005 |
| Ensemble | 0.75 | 0.85 | 0.88 | 200ms | $0.001 |
| Ensemble + Rerank | **0.90** | **0.85** | **0.94** | 250ms | $0.003 |

**Winner:** Ensemble + Reranking
- Best overall quality
- Reasonable cost and latency
- Production-ready
